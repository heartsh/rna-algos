# "rna-algos", Library of Algorithms in RNAs
This library provides algorithms in RNAs.
Current available algorithms are the [gamma-centroid structure estimator](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/25/4/465/248190) and [McCaskill's algorithm](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/bip.360290621).
To model RNA secondary structure scoring, [Turner 2004 model](https://rna.urmc.rochester.edu/NNDB/) and [CONTRAfold v2.02](http://contra.stanford.edu/contrafold/) model are available.
More descriptions of these two scoring models are [here](https://github.com/heartsh/rna-ss-params)[]().
